### 2020.08.10

No big changes to the script. Added `--json` options and watch script to help testing and development. As well as a few new keys to the output array:  

``` shell
i3list["XAB"] # family AB workspace
i3list["XAC"] # family AC workspace
i3list["XCD"] # family CD workspace
i3list["XBD"] # family BD workspace

i3list["VPA"] # virtual position A
i3list["VPB"] # virtual position B
i3list["VPC"] # virtual position C
i3list["VPD"] # virtual position D
```
